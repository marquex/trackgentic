# Hire Expert

Use this skill to create a new expert agent for the project. The skill guides you through gathering all required information and creating the agent file following the expert agent template.

## Agent Hierarchy

Agents are organized in a manager-subordinate hierarchy. Task assignment flows through trackgentic issues — managers create and assign issues, subordinates pick them up and work on them.

- Every agent can have a **manager** (an agent that assigns work to it via trackgentic issues).
- Every agent can have **subordinates** (agents it can assign work to via trackgentic issues).
- An agent at the top of the hierarchy has no manager.
- A leaf agent has no subordinates.
- The hierarchy can have many levels.

## Required Information

Before creating the agent, you need to gather the following:

1. **Name** — a kebab-case identifier (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `data-analyst`). Used as the agent file name and expertise folder name.
2. **Role description** — a clear description of the agent's purpose, what domain it specializes in, and when to use it. This becomes the `description` field in the frontmatter and the core of the system prompt.
3. **Folder access** — the folders the agent needs to access (read-only or read-write). These become `access` rules. The agent's own expertise folder (`.agentic/expertise/{name}/**`) is always included with read/write/delete.
4. **Manager** — which existing agent is this agent's manager. If specified, the manager agent will be updated to include this new agent as a subordinate. If not specified, this agent is a top-level agent.
5. **Subordinates** — which existing agents this agent can assign work to. If specified, the agent's system prompt will include a "Coordinating Work" section with instructions for creating trackgentic issues for subordinates. If not specified, this is a leaf agent.
6. **Model** (optional) — the model for the agent. Defaults to `sonnet` if not specified.

## Steps

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Parse the user's description

The user provides a description of the expert they want to hire. Extract from it as much of the required information as possible.

### Step 2: Ask follow-up questions for missing information

If any required information is missing from the description, ask the user follow-up questions to gather it. Be specific about what you need. Group related questions together to minimize back-and-forth.

Information that can be inferred or defaulted does not need to be asked:
- If no model is specified, default to `sonnet`.
- If the role description is clear enough, derive the folder access from it (e.g., a `code-reviewer` likely needs access to source files, a `data-analyst` needs access to data files). However, if it's ambiguous, ask.

For manager and subordinates:
- If neither manager nor subordinates are mentioned, ask about both: "Who is this agent's manager? And who are its subordinates (if any)?"
- If a manager is mentioned but no subordinates, ask: "What agents can {name} assign work to? Or is it a leaf agent with no subordinates?"
- If subordinates are mentioned but no manager, ask: "Who is {name}'s manager? Which agent assigns work to it?"
- If both are mentioned, no need to ask further about the hierarchy.
- You can also suggest a hierarchy position based on the role description (e.g., a "CEO" agent should be at the top, a "code-reviewer" likely reports to a "tech-lead" or "project-manager").

### Step 3: Confirm with the user

Before creating the agent, present a summary of the agent configuration to the user for confirmation:
- Name
- Description
- Folder access rules (with permissions)
- Manager (or "top-level agent" if none)
- Subordinates (or "leaf agent" if none)
- Model

Wait for the user to confirm or request changes.

### Step 4: Create the agent file

Create the agent file at `.claude/agents/{name}.md` following this template:

```md
---
name: {name}
description: {description — concise, explains domain, purpose, and when to use it}
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: {model — defaults to sonnet}
skills:
  - agent-expertise
  - trackgentic
  - trackgentic-implement
subordinates: {list of subordinate agent names, or omit if none}
access:
  - path: .agentic/expertise/{name}/**
    permissions: [read, write, delete]
  - path: {folder}/**
    permissions: [read]
  {additional access rules as needed}
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Read|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "bun .claude/hooks/enforce-agent-access.ts"
  SessionStart:
    - hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "bun .claude/skills/agent-expertise/expertise.hook.ts"
  UserPromptSubmit:
    - hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "bun .claude/skills/agent-expertise/expertise.hook.ts"
  Stop:
    - hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "bun .claude/skills/agent-expertise/expertise.hook.ts"
---

{System prompt — sets the agent's direction and goals. Should NOT include specific step-by-step instructions. Instead, describe the agent's purpose, what it should aim to achieve, and let the agent learn how to achieve it through its expertise.}

{if has subordinates, add a "## Coordinating Work" section:}

## Coordinating Work

You coordinate work by creating trackgentic issues and assigning them to your subordinate agents. The agent runner will automatically pick up the issues and launch the agents.

To assign work to a subordinate:
```bash
TRACKGENTIC_TOKEN="$TOKEN" trackgentic create "Task description" --assignee <agent-name> --status todo --priority 2
```

{if has a manager, add:}

Your manager is `{manager-name}` — you receive assigned tasks from it.

## Using trackgentic as the issue tracker

You manage your work through trackgentic issues. Use the `trackgentic` skill to create, update, and monitor issues. Follow the issue flow outlined in the `trackgentic-implement` skill for best practices on how to pick up, execute, report, and hand back issues effectively.

IMPORTANT: Your trackgentic token is `<token-here>`.

## Restricted domain

You have access to the following folders:

<!-- ACCESS_RULES -->
```

Key rules for the agent file:
- The system prompt should be directional, not prescriptive. Let the agent build expertise on how to achieve its goals.
- Always include the `agent-expertise`, `trackgentic`, and `trackgentic-implement` skills. Manager agents should also include `issue`.
- Only include `Write` and `Edit` in the `tools` list if the agent needs to write to files outside its expertise folder. Most expert agents only need read access to their domain files.
- Always include the `PreToolUse` hook for `enforce-agent-access.ts`.
- Always include the `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop` hooks for `expertise.hook.ts`. These handle expertise injection at session start and expertise update reminders at session end. The hook uses flag-based dedup so double-firing is safe.
- Always include the `<!-- ACCESS_RULES -->` marker in the Restricted domain section. The PostToolUse hook `inject-agent-markers.ts` expands it at runtime when the file is read — the marker stays in the file on disk and is never replaced with hardcoded content. The frontmatter `access` block is the single source of truth.
- NEVER hardcode the access rules in the system prompt. Always use the marker. The frontmatter is the single source of truth.
- The token enforcement hook (`enforce-trackgentic-token.ts`) and issue cleanup hook (`enforce-issue-cleanup.ts`) are registered project-wide in `.claude/settings.json`, so they don't need to be added to individual agent frontmatter.

### Step 5: Register the agent in trackgentic

After creating the agent file, register the agent as a trackgentic user:

```bash
trackgentic users register {name}
```

This returns a token. Add it to the agent file's system prompt in the format:

```
IMPORTANT: Your trackgentic token is `<token>`.
```

### Step 6: Update the manager agent (if a manager was specified)

If the new agent has a manager, you must update the manager's agent file to include the new agent as a subordinate:

1. Read the manager's agent file at `.claude/agents/{manager-name}.md`.
2. In the YAML frontmatter:
   - Add the new agent to the `subordinates` list (create the list if it doesn't exist).
3. In the system prompt:
   - If there is already a `## Coordinating Work` section, no change needed — the agent already knows how to assign issues.
   - If there is no `## Coordinating Work` section, add one before the `## Restricted domain` section with instructions for creating trackgentic issues for subordinates.
4. Write the updated manager file.

### Step 7: Update the subordinates' manager reference (if subordinates were specified)

If the new agent has subordinates, you should check each subordinate agent's file to see if it references its manager. If a subordinate's system prompt mentions its old manager (or no manager), update it to reference the new agent as its manager. This keeps the hierarchy documentation consistent across all agent files.

### Step 8: Create the expertise folder

Create the expertise folder and index file at `.agentic/expertise/{name}/{name}-index.yaml` with this initial content:

```yaml
# {Name} Expertise Index
# Agent: {name}
# Domain: {brief domain description}

hierarchy:
  manager: {manager name, or "none — top-level agent"}
  subordinates: [{list of subordinate names, or "none — leaf agent"}]

expertise_status: "New agent — no expertise accumulated yet. Start building expertise from the first session."
```

### Step 9: Validate

After creating the agent and updating any related agents:
1. Read back all modified files to confirm the content is correct and well-formed.
2. Verify the YAML frontmatter is valid in each modified agent file.
3. Verify the hierarchy is consistent — if A is B's manager, then B should appear in A's subordinates list, and A should be mentioned as B's manager.
4. Test the new hook scripts execute without errors: `echo '{}' | bun .claude/hooks/enforce-trackgentic-token.ts`
